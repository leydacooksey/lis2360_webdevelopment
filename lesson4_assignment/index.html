        Obviously the main goal to be obtained from college is to earn a degree. But if you had the chace to learn and gain other qualities making you more desirable in the working world, wouldn't you take it?

    <p>
    Leadership is one of the most desirable qualities in an employee. Leadership skills show that a person is confident, commited, and accountable.
    </p>
    <p>
        One organization that instills the qualities of a leader in their members is Alpha Kappa Psi. Alpha Kappa Psi is a business fraternity that I have recently pledged at Florida State University. While joining this organization has countless benefits relating to the workforce and professionalism, the greatest quality I have gained thus far is leadership.

        <h1> Leadership Opportunities in College </h1>
        <h2> <em>Overview</em></h2>
    </body>
    <p>
        While attending a college or university, the opportunities to get involved are endless. Whether it is a club, greek life, or volunteering, organizations to join are everywhere.

        Obviously the main goal to be obtained from college is to earn a degree. But if you had the chace to learn and gain other qualities making you more desirable in the working world, wouldn't you take it?
    </p>
    <p>
    Leadership is one of the most desirable qualities in an employee. Leadership skills show that a person is confident, commited, and accountable.

        One organization that instills the qualities of a leader in their members is Alpha Kappa Psi. Alpha Kappa Psi is a business fraternity that I have recently pledged at Florida State University. While joining this organization has countless benefits relating to the workforce and professionalism, the greatest quality I have gained thus far is leadership.
